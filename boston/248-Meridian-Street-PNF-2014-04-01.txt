1.0 Executive Summary

1.1 Introduction

The Project Notification Form is submitted this day of February 15, 2008 in accordance
with Article 80 of the Boston Zoning Code. The Proponent, The Seville on Boston
Harbor LLC is a Joint Venture of the Lombardo Companies and Global Property
Developers Corporation. The Joint Venture is a limited liability corporation formed
between a long time East Boston landowner--The Lombardo Companies and Global
Property Developers Corporation, its developer. The Proponent will be represented by the
Honorable Joseph Tierney Esq.

The Development Team has collaborated on several projects across the State including
the Liberty Plaza in East Boston. The site located at 248-270 Meridian Street extends one
city block west from Meridian Street to Border Street. The proposed Project is a mixed-
use building to be located on site of the old Seville Theater. The Seville Theater will be
demolished to make way for the construction of a six-story building, which will
accommodate retail/commercial space, as well as 65 one and two bedroom residential
condominiums with structured parking.

The site is a 17,841sf urban parcel in East Boston that extends from Meridian Street to
the east to Border Street to the west. It is close to Central Square and opposite Liberty
Plaza on the Border Street side. It is located in the Overlay Community Commercial
District.

The proposed commercial/retail spaces will enhance existing storefronts now active on
both streetscapes. Five (5) floors of residential space will be developed above the
commercial and retail spaces providing prime new space. Most condominiums will have
outstanding views of Boston Harbor, Charlestown Navy Yard, or Logan International
Airport.

The privately funded Project represents an investment in the future growth of the
Meridian Street Business District. The Project will provide excellent new harbor view
residential opportunities for those interested in East Boston's revitalized housing sector.

As a mixed-use redevelopment near the waterfront, the commercial and residential mid-
rise Project will reinforce/continue the ongoing modernization of East Boston's new
waterfront developments. The new retail/commercial spaces should encourage the
community to modernize and upgrade their street fronts. The upscale modern residential
component will increase property values and help promote/sustain the area's economic
viability.

The Proponent has filed a letter of intent with Boston Redevelopment Authority notifying
them that the Project Notification Form will be filed February 15, 2008. The Proponent
has started the Large Project review process under Article 80 with the filing of the Letter
of Intent. The Proponent has also spoken to city agencies, politicians, the Mayor's Office,



The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                          Page 1
and neighborhood groups per the direction of the BRA and Mayor's Office of
Neighborhood Affairs. The Proponent has also held a well-attended open public forum.

1.2 Proposed Project

1.2.1   Project Site and Context

The Project Site is located at 248-270 Meridian Street with commercial/retail storefronts
on both Meridian Street and Border Street. The Seville Theater occupies the site, an
imposing masonry building built in the late 1920's. It has not functioned as a theatre
since the 1980's. The building is currently utilized for limited commercial and retail
purposes, comprising two stories on each street front elevation.

The parcel occupies 17,481sf- WARD1, Map 1058, Parcel 5937. It is abutted to the north
by City of Boston land, on which the East Boston Library sits. A public stair connects
Border and Meridian Streets on the library site close to the northern property line. The
stairs traverse the grade differential between gently sloping Meridian Street and relatively
level Border Street, an elevation difference of approximately 14 feet. Sidewalks exist on
both streets, as do curb cuts for deliveries; (a) Meridian Street via a private alley
easement and (b) overhead doors to the theater, previously used for shipping/deliveries.

To the east--the Meridian Street elevation faces retail/commercial mixed-use buildings
of older construction with various fenestration types. On the Meridian Street side of the
site on the northeast corner there is a private alley that is a light and air easement on this
site, which separates the property from 272-274 Meridian Street, owned by Bruce
Yochum. The northerly return of this private alley terminates where the adjacent
properties converge and the theater's rear wall serves as a two story recorded common
party wall to the northerly end of each buildings foundation visible from the public way
on the library site.

The southerly elevation of the property is an independent wall system abutted by two
commercial and mixed-use properties, one owned by the Lombardo Companies and
occupied by Tello's and, the other by Luis Vasco at, 244 Meridian Street. A small
alleyway separates those abutter properties at their rear lot lines.

The westerly elevation along Border Street, opposite the Liberty Plaza, is East Boston's
economic hub. The westerly boundary of Liberty Plaza is on Boston Harbor and is the
primary shopping area for East Boston.

The site is 100% covered by building mass, abutted on two sides by sidewalks and
asphalt roads. The site's redevelopment will utilize the entire footprint of the current
building parcel.




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                             Page 2
1.2.2   Project Description

The Project proposes the redevelopment of the site with a mixed-use residential and
retail/commercial center. It has two primary street façades, edging Border and Meridian
Streets, with a substantial grade difference between the two streets. The new Seville will
have two ground level floors providing a range of potential retail and commercial uses.
This enhancement should stimulate other new street façade improvements. East Boston
Main Street and the Chamber of Commerce have enthusiastically/positively endorsed the
revitalization of the Seville Theater site.

As an established neighborhood, East Boston has engaged in several development
discussions and many existing property renovations over the last several years. It should
be noted that East Boston overall, has lower housing values as compared to other city
neighborhoods and also the volume of new construction condominiums in the
neighborhood has been significantly less than in other parts of the city. This unique
Project therefore, with its prime location, access to the harbor, shopping and the T-bus
routes place the Seville in a much sought after location in East Boston. The site provides
panoramic views of many of the city's best known attractions/sites: an active Harbor,
Downtown, Logan Airport, the Charlestown Navy Yard, Tobin Bridge, Zachim Bridge,
the Old North Church, the TD North Garden, etc. The Seville Site is close to Central
Square, and is only a four-block walk from Maverick Square's Blue Line and there are
also multiple bus line services on its Meridian Street elevation.

1.3 Summary of Project Impacts

1.3.1 Urban Design

Careful consideration has been given to the design of this new mixed use building by the
Development Team. The massing of the proposed building is similar to the masonary
building it replaces, however the form and multiple facets of the new facades together
with a palette of bright, cast/stone and generous fenestration will endow this site with a
much needed transformation. The residential units are stepped back on the upper floors to
maintain the scale of the local neighborhood. Many of the units will have balconies or
terraces with views of the Inner Harbor or Airport. 13% of the units will be affordable
and available to households that meet the BRA's affordable housing income limits. The
Seville at Boston Harbor is graphically illustrated by ICON architecture with plans,
perspectives and photographs (Figures 3-1 through 3-17) that are included at the end of
Section 3.

The site is located in the Community Commercial District that overlooks Boston Harbor
to the west and at higher elevations to the east, the throngs of Logan's airport traffic
patterns. The residential units take advantage of these exceptional viewpoints. Further the
location of the building with entries provided on both streets, with direct access to north
and south bound routes permits easy commercial access.

The proposed mixed-use development will be an investment in an eco-centric area of the
city that will benefit greatly from economic stimulation. The concept meets the intent of
local zoning and will balance a cadre of site elements needed to provide economic
stimulus in the area.

The existing building's massive masonry presence and façades will be replaced with a
new structure of similar mass but incorporating a modern architectural vocabulary with
traditional materials. This retail/commercial and residential function will create urban
energy in a formerly underutilized site overlooking the Harbor and Central Square.

The design of the new structure will blend elements of the existing area and building's
masonry character with an architecturally pleasing modern new residential styling. The
building's name and orientation will radiate a central theme, Boston Harbor. The
schematic elevations submitted for your review reflect a commitment to the future end
users. We have integrated neighborhood elements and history and embraced a change for
the future of East Boston's harbor front/cityscape.

Design is projected to include maximized views of the harbor, concern for the
environment, use of green LEED concept and energystar design, city security and
utilization of minimized parking elements.

The Project plan intends to build roughly 74,000sf of residential space and 13,000-
14,000sf of commercial- retail/flex space on the site. The Project is planned to




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                          Page 4
incorporate 40 parking spaces serving residential owners. Many residential owners will
enjoy harbor or airport views from decks, either common or for their exclusive use.

1.3.2 Transportation Impacts

Section 5.0 of this PNF provides a transportation study completed recently by Howard/
Stein-Hudson Associates Inc. (HSH). The study was performed to meet the BTD
Transportation Access Plan Guidelines (2001).

Transportation issues remain the most discussed issues of any new project. Due to the
densities of traffic in the Central Square area the current Project has no significant impact
on the area. It is never quite that simple and HSH presents its study for a complete
review. The study outlines actual traffic counts at the building as well as proposed new
vehicle trips during peak times.

The transportation plan proposed addresses the integration of the revitalized site with its
road systems. Improvements, mitigation and justification with existing road systems are
presented for review.

Parking as part of the transportation impact review has also been addressed. A parking
ratio of 0.7 vehicles per residential market rate unit is proposed. This proposal is
consistent with master plan recommendations and meets the LEED process design intent
to reduce urban footprint carbon emissions.

Due to the unique parking situation that exists across Border Street at the Liberty Plaza,
overflow parking can be addressed without impact to the local on street parking through a
licensed sticker system.

The Proponent will explore proactive transportation demand management measures
(TDM). The Applicant will consider the use of amenities to encourage and support
resident use of mass transit, walking and bicycling in an effort to minimize the Project's
carbon footprint.

1.3.3 Wind

The proposed Project is similar in mass and therefore does not significantly modify
existing wind patterns established in the 1920s. The redevelopment of the site is projected
to mass in a similar fashion along the north, south and west facing elevations. Building
height will not exceed 70 feet from average grade, classifying the structure as a mid-rise.
The current building's heights range from 50 to 88 feet from the streets, with the main
portion of the largest building's flat roof at 80 feet off a street elevation of 19.

There are no hi-rise buildings in the Project's vicinity. Since the Project and its
surroundings do not historically create any wind velocities that are dangerous or exceed
acceptable levels, the overall wind environment is not expected to change as a result of
the Project.



The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                           Page 5
1.3.4 Shadow

The Project shadow profile will remain similar to the historic structures. Shadow lines
cast in the afternoon are currently the only ones that effect residential units in mixed-use
buildings along Meridian Street. The commercial area is abutted on all sides by two-story
street level retail, institutional and some second story retail with village/urban residential
at the second through fourth stories of several abutting structures along Meridian. There
are no residential abutters along Border Street.

1.3.5 Daylight

No adverse impact from daylight on streets or pedestrian ways is noted, or has been noted
from the existing structure into public record. Therefore the proposed building mass and
size provides no noted daylight obstruction. The existing structure creates the context for
the area. No significant massing change for the proposed building indicates there will be
no variation in potential daylight obstructions keeping the Project consistent in its
relationship with the commercial mixed-use neighborhood setting,

1.3.6 Solar Glare

No solar glare impacts will result from the Project because traditional building materials
are to be considered.

1.3.7 Air Quality Impacts

The proposed Project will not require preparation of a micro scale (carbon monoxide) air
quality analysis, because there is no intersection abutting the site. Transportation study
information will indicate nearby traffic grids are near impact status and the level of
service impacts cannot deteriorate to a 10% impact in traffic. The Project is on two bus
routes that stop at Central Square, which is one block away from the site.

Construction air quality impacts will be addressed in the Construction Management Plan.

1.3.8 Noise Impacts

The Project will comply with Mass DEP noise policy and City of Boston noise
regulations. The site sits on a 24/7 eco-center one block from Central Square. The noise
routinely received includes busses along Meridian, vehicle traffic at Central Square and
foot traffic. Logan does not contribute as the flight path patterns are outside this section
of East Boston. The Project's traffic and functional uses will require zero known
mitigation to meet City of Boston and Mass DEP noise regulations. The Project design
will not have any adverse impact on existing sound levels of the surrounding
environment. Construction impacts will be addressed in the Construction Management
Plan.




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                            Page 6
1.3.9 Wetlands/Flood Hazard Zones

The existing Project Site is not part of any wetland resource area regulated by the Mass
Wetlands Protection Act. No portion of the Project lies within the FEMA flood zones
(See Appendix E).

The Project will not require conservation review. It exists on an urban block with no
existing flood plane issues and is outside the jurisdiction of the Wetlands Protection Act.

1.3.10 Stormwater Management/Water Quality

The Project will include a Stormwater Management program designed to meet
compliance with Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC) requirements. As a
mature urban site, demolition drainage of stormwater and construction will include per-
treatment prior to discharge into the stormwater municipal system. The Construction
Management Plan will include detailed operational procedure to assure no adverse impact
to local water quality.

Erosion and sediment control measures during construction will eliminate the transport of
on site soils off site. Controls to local catch basins will be inspected and maintained
throughout construction until all disturbed areas have been stabilized.

Future building mitigation plans include the use of catch basins with sumps, potentially
an oil/water/grease trap, and use of an operations and maintenance plan. Signage will be
placed at garage areas once built and where construction work is done bearing the phrase,
"Don't dispose oil ­ it will drain to Boston Harbor."

1.3.11 Solid and Hazardous Materials

The Proponent will accommodate recycling measures meeting or exceeding the city's
recycling guidelines. Construction contracts will include specific requirements for
contractor compliance with recycling.

The Project Site is not in violation of the Mass Contingency Plan (MCP) and is not listed
on the List to Be Investigated, LTBI, nor is it a known RCRA polluter or superfund listed
site. Due to the age of the structure, asbestos and PCB light ballasts exist and will be
removed prior to any demolition to remain in compliance with the EPA NESHAPS, The
Clean Air Act as well as EPA - The Toxic Substance Control Act, (TSCA).

1.3.12 Geotechnical & Groundwater Impacts

Existing subsurface conditions and geotechnical impacts of the Project are detailed in
section 4.9, Geotechnical and Groundwater Impacts. Subsurface conditions have been
reviewed to the extent possible:




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                          Page 7
Based on the knowledge of the subsurface soil conditions it is known that the existing
structure is a traditional foundation supported on, what appears to be, spread footings.
The footings are supported by continuous bearing. Borings indicate compact to dense
sand and silt, some gravel with cobbles and boulders under the glacial outwash. New
building support needs will substantially mirror those of the existing building and
portions of the foundation are tentatively planned to remain.

The groundwater sheds from Meridian Street toward the harbor at levels that are not
currently proposed to be disturbed. Discharge to BSW of site storm water should not be
required, however if site treatment becomes needed a dewatering permit will be applied
for prior to "discharging to the system." No blasting is anticipated for the Project.

1.3.13 Construction Analysis

The Seville on Boston Harbor will be built and staged over a projected sixteen to
eighteen (16-18) months. The Construction Management Plan (CMP) will be the center
of construction control policy. The CMP is created to safeguard the process through strict
adherence to schedule and gaining contractor synergies. As a site with a common party
wall, and by being an urban setting, only methodologies that ensure public safety across
the site will be accepted. Only general contractors with an ability to show a history of
safety on urban settings will be given consideration in contractor selection.

The CMP will be submitted to BTD for review and acknowledgement prior to
construction commencement. The CMP will address the following:

        1. Safety Policy
        2. Schedule
        3. Construction worker commuting
        4. Construction worker parking
        5. Delivery routes for trucks and idling
        6. Acceptable delivery schedule times
        7. Site dust control--maintenance
        8. Staging of materials
        9. Impact analysis to abutters with mitigation
        10. Control policies for noise, air quality, and storm water (if necessary)

1.3.14 Historic Resources

The Project does not contain historic structures that are listed on the National or State
Register of Historic Places, or in the MA Historic Commission's (MHC) Inventory of
Historic and Archeological Assets of the Commonwealth.

The abutting, City of Boston property, know as the East Boston Public Library is known
as the oldest branch library in the city, per conversations with local abutters. The city and
neighborhood civic groups are discussing library options for the future.

The Proponent will confer with the Boston Landmarks Commission regarding the need
for filing a Request for Determination of Applicability under Article 85 Demolition
Delay of the Boston Zoning Code prior to building demolition.

1.3.15 Infrastructure Systems

Infrastructure systems review of this PNF contains existing information regarding water,
sewer, gas, electric and other utilities. Preliminary contact and subsequent research have
been initiated with the agencies responsible for the area's utility systems including
BWSC to preview the availability of utilities to serve the Project.

The Proponent will submit a site plan and general service application to BWSC for
review and approval. In addition, a site preparation plan will be submitted specifying best
management measures for protecting the BWSC drainage system during construction. All
engineering work for utility connection, including BWSC will continue as design
finalization moves forward.

2.0     GENERAL INFORMATION

2.1     Proponent Information

2.1.1   Project Proponent

The proponent for The Seville on Boston Harbor is a joint venture between two family
owned and operated companies, Global Property Developers Corporation and The
Lombardo Companies. Global has included its history of its lineage under separate
section but it provides an overview of our development line of services. The Lombardo
Companies, as most know, are long time property owners in East Boston. Founded by
Salvatore Lombardo, the Lombardo Companies have owned and operated significant
businesses and properties in East Boston for over 60 years. As proud members of the
East Boston community, we again look to augment the community by proposing
investment in bettering the existing building site and adding new taxable property to the
community. The project should add value to the properties surrounding Central Square
and bring additional revenues by adding residential buyers and new businesses.

The Callahan Companies and the Lombardo's have a thirty-five, (35) yearlong
association. The Lombardo's and Callahan's have built, renovated and developed in
multiple locations across the state, but have a long history in East Boston.

The two firm's association includes the renovation, re-construction and development of
the Lombardo's properties, including the original Lombardo's Function Facility in East
Boston (ballroom, kitchens, bars), Liberty Market, Liberty Plaza, and the newer
Lombardo's Function Facility in Randolph. Most recently the East Boston
redevelopment of the Plaza included the construction of the Shaw's Supermarket and a
realignment of the Plaza's infrastructure.

The Lombardo Companies and Global have also developed together on a grander scale.
Ballymeade Country Club and Estates is a thousand acre plus community located in
Falmouth on Cape Cod. Together the Callahan and Lombardo Companies completed a
golf and housing community, one of the largest private projects built on the Cape.
Between the efforts in urban and suburban communities, our teams have a track record
for achieving success in real estate development. As a development team, the two firms
provide a long time history of working well together and their staffs compliment one
another.

For the proposed program, The Lombardo Companies and Global will create a JV and re-
develop the old Seville Theater into a Commercial and Residential mixed use structure.
The project will bring new retail to Central Square and add new housing to East Boston
that better serves current market owners. The new Seville will orient itself toward
Boston Harbor and create new life on the under utilized parcel that is so convenient to the
eco-center Liberty Plaza and its size will capture and highlight the exceptional views of
the Harbor and overlook much of the cityscape and landmarks synonymous to Boston.

2.2       Public Benefits

Redevelopment of the Seville Theatre site will result in a number of public benefits for
the Central Square and East Boston neighborhoods and overall for the City of Boston.
These benefits include:

      ·    Converting the underutilized former Seville Theater site into a 24/7 mixed-use
           building;
      ·    Bring new life to the neighborhood with active retail storefronts on two streets;
      ·    Offering opportunities for affordable housing by creating up to 8 new affordable
           homeownership units and a total of 65 new housing units in the City of East
           Boston;
      ·    Promoting a safe 24-hour use on a site that has been underused since the 1980's;
      ·    Creating construction phase employment opportunities, creating new permanent
           jobs in the retail and management positions upon completion.

2.3       Regulatory Controls and Permits

2.3.1      Current Zoning and Proposed Uses

The Project Site is located in the Central Square Neighborhood Business Subdistrict, and
designated Community Commercial Subdistrict (CC) as established under the Boston
Zoning Code and as shown on Zoning Map 3A/3B. This subdistrict is intended to provide
a diversified commercial environment to serve a large market, and to encourage the
development of neighborhood businesses that provide essential goods and services as
well as jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities for the community. The Proponent
proposes two floors of new retail space accessible from both Meridian Street and Border
Street, with multifamily housing above, and parking below, all of which are allowed uses
by Article 53, Table B.

2.3.2      Zoning and Dimensional Requirements

The Proponent will seek Board of Appeal relief for a building height variance to
authorize the proposed height, which is similar in scale to the existing building. The
Proponent may apply for such incidental dimensional and similar relief as may be
required to accommodate the design of the improvements developed during the Article 80
process. The proponent will also seek relief for an increase in Floor Area Ratio, as the
proposed Project is located in a highly active shopping district and near public
transportation. Table 2-1 presents the zoning data.

3.0     Urban Component

3.1     Introduction

This section presents the urban design elements of the proposed Project. Plans,
perspectives, and photographs are included at the end of this section (see Figures 3-1
through 3-17).

3.2     Site Context

The Project Site is bounded on the East by Meridian Street, and to the West by Border
Street. To the South, the parcel meets "Tello's" clothing store and "Taco Mania"
restaurant. The Site abuts the East Boston Public Library to the North, and shares a party-
wall with the back of the property addressed at 272-274 Meridian Street. The lot area is
approximately 17,481 square feet, and consists of the underused Seville Theatre, and
several storefronts on Meridian Street. Approximately 14 feet of grade differentiates the
two public streets.

Located directly across from the Liberty Plaza parking area at Central Square and Shaw's
grocery store, the site has views toward Boston's Inner Harbor. On Border Street to the
North and beyond the 3-4 story Library are a number of tightly spaced three-and-a-half
story multifamily homes, and to the South is the two-story brick Tello's clothing store.
Along Meridian Street, the streetscape is made up of primarily three- and four- story
masonry and wood-frame buildings, with attractive retail on the ground level.

The nearby MTBA station at Maverick Square is currently being rebuilt, enhancing the
transit service for the short ride to downtown Boston, and a number of residential and
mixed-use projects are underway or are being evaluated for future use in the East Boston
neighborhood. The new Seville will enliven these streetscapes, as well as bring greater
activity to Central Square.

3.3     Building Design

3.3.1    Design Concept

The proposed Project has two primary street faces, edging Border and Meridian Streets,
with a large grade change between the two streets. The new Seville will have a "ground"
and "street level" commercial floor, providing a range of potential retail uses. These two
floor plans are shown with their street context in Figures 3-6 and 3-7. The Project
commercially will provide a mix of uses, with the two levels of retail, and 65 residential
units above. The lobby will be accessible from both street levels and serve as a marketing
feature.




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                        Page 18
3.3.2   Height and Massing

The overall massing strategy for the proposed Project is to maintain the sidewalk/street
edge and to step back on the upper floors to maximize upper level views.

The proposed Project will approximately match the height of the tallest section of the
existing Seville Theatre building. Facing Border Street, the building façade will rise
commercially with a portion of the façade at a two story height. The residential stories of
the building will step back significantly from the street, in three vertical segments on the
southeast corner. The sixth floor will also be set back from the street, creating outdoor
space for the residents (Figure 3-12).

Along Meridian Street, the majority of the building will read as a four story building; the
two uppermost floors will be set back approximately eight feet from the sidewalk edge.
While the significant setback on Border Street maximizes views, on Meridian Street, the
northern corner is held at one story to minimize the new building's impact on the abutter
(Figure 3-15).

3.3.3   Façade Design, Fenestration, and Building Materials

The architectural character and use of materials on the new Seville will create an elegant
addition to the neighborhood. The building will be primarily masonry on the facades of
the lower floors, while the top levels will include a proposed composite metal panel
system.

Cast stone bands are planned to delineate a strong base to distinguish the retail levels
from the residential above, with proposed inset cast/stone banding and exterior lighting to
add scale and interest between storefront windows. The retail spaces will be further
highlighted on the Border Street elevation with vertically connected fenestration and a
signage band between the two retail levels, while on the Meridian Street elevation, the
single story storefronts will be heightened with signage bands above the windows. The
northern façade will have inset balconies of glass and metal, and the masonry on each
side will have cast stone banding and decorative brick detailing.

The top two floors will be a light-colored metal panel system, resting on a cast stone cap
which wraps the proposed building.

3.4     Site Design

The Project Site is bounded by existing streets on two sides (Meridian and Border
Streets), the East Boston Public Library to the Northwest, the multi-use building at the
Northeast, and retail buildings to the South. The proposed Project will be built to existing
lot lines on all sides, except for respecting the Light and Air Easement near the multi-use
building. Various pedestrian entrances for both residents and retail users will increase
activity and safety at the street level.




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                         Page 19
3.4.1 Open Space and Landscaped Areas

This Project Site has a natural amenity based on its proximity to the Boston Harbor and
the East Boston Harborwalk. Many of the residences will have gracious decks or patios.

3.4.2      Pedestrian Circulation

The Proposed building design, program, and scale will enhance pedestrian activity on the
Project Site. Residential and several retail entrances will be on both Meridian and Border
Streets. Pedestrian activity on the site will add a sense of security to the neighborhood
and increase the "eyes" on the street.

3.4.3      Parking and Vehicular Circulation

The Project Site is located one block away from Central Square. The new Border Street
retail spaces will be directly across the street from the Liberty Plaza, the Shaw's grocery
store and parking at Liberty Plaza. Both Meridian and Border Streets allow two-way
vehicle traffic. Retail parking will be on-street only. Residential vehicular traffic will
enter the building via an entrance at each face of the building. On Border Street traffic
will ramp into the parking levels. Overall, the proposed parking ratio will be 0.7 parking
spaces per market rate residential unit, with 40 spaces in two below-grade levels.

Trash from the proposed Project will be collected and compacted in an enclosed trash and
recycling room within the parking area of the building, and will be rolled out to Boarder
Street for pickup. This procedure mirrors the operational process in place for the
building.

3.5       Sustainable Design and Energy-Conservation Measures

3.5.1       Sustainable Design Strategies

The Project will meet the City of Boston's Rule 37 Green design requirements.

The Project will be replacing an underused building transitioning Meridian and Border
Streets, commercial district. ICON's design fulfills several goals of smart growth strategy
by providing a range of housing options (both by type and price); creating a cohesive
design that incorporates efficient unit layouts with pedestrian and transportation
convenient site. The Proponent is proposing the formation of a condominium association
to ensure the future viability of the Project; and offering a financially feasible high-
quality residential community to replace the existing structure in an existing mixed-use
neighborhood. Specific strategies promoting sustainability and energy-conservation
include:

      ·    Creating a Range of Housing Opportunities and Choices: The Project offers
           homeownership opportunities offered at diverse price levels.



The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                         Page 20
    ·   Fostering Distinctive, Attractive Communities with a Strong Sense of Place: The
        design of the Project is cohesive and creates an overarching identity for the new
        section of the neighborhood.
    ·   Strengthening and Directing Development Towards Existing Communities: The
        Project proposes the redevelopment and elimination of an underused building, and
        new construction of a residential development that will provide public
        commercial amenities to the whole neighborhood.
    ·   Providing Compact Building Design: The Project offers efficient unit layouts at
        minimal footprint with amenities that correspond to those offered by conventional
        typologies.

Energy-Efficient Measures and Practices

Global and its design team are considering a broad range of green and sustainable
features for the Project. The Proponent has been actively following the development of
the Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design ("LEEDR") green building rating
system. In addition, the Proponent intends to meet Rule 37 targets for the energy-
efficiency of the proposed new buildings to the greatest extent possible.

Specific characteristics of the Project and suggested measures are briefly listed below. In
some of these areas, the Project will commit to the incorporation of the noted green
features. In others, it is anticipated that the team will implement an integrated design
process to fully evaluate and explore the feasibility of the proposed measures.

4.0 Environmental Protection Component

4.1 Wind

The Project is not expected to create adverse wind impacts on adjacent buildings, open
space or pedestrian areas since the current building mass is in similar form. The current
building has been in place since the late 1920's.

No high-rise buildings exist in proximity to the Project that create wind velocities
exceeding BRA guidelines at or on an effective 31 mph gust. Overall, the wind
environment in this East Boston location is not expected to have a significant impact as a
result of the modification of the Seville site.

4.2 Shadow

As is typically required by the BRA, a shadow impact analysis was conducted to
investigate shadow impacts from the proposed project. The study tracked the sun and
resulting shadow during three time periods (9:00 AM, 12:00 noon and 3 PM) during the
vernal equinox (March 21), summer solstice (June 21), autumnal equinox (September 21)
and the winter solstice (December 21). In addition, shadow studies were conducted for
the 6:00 PM time period during the summer solstice and autumnal equinox.

The shadow analysis presents net new shadow from the building, as well as existing
shadows and illustrates the incremental impact of the project (see Appendix D). The
analysis focuses on the public spaces and major pedestrian areas adjacent to and in the
vicinity of the site.

The site is oriented between Border and Meridian Street, which both run on a North-
South axis. In the morning the shadow will remain relatively similar to the one cast by
the existing Seville Theater. The proposed building will create very little new shadow on
the Shaw's supermarket across Border St to the West. The new building will also cast
less shadow than the existing building in the South-West corner sidewalk due to the
stepping-back of the proposed building. The shadow cast during the middle of the day is
almost exactly the same due to the similar mass and proportion on the Northern side of
the proposed and existing buildings. As the sun comes around into the evening sunset the
amount of new shadow cast increases, but mostly is a combined shadow that would have
previously been cast by existing buildings.

Overall the additional shadow cast by the proposed building is negligible and will not
affect the surrounding buildings in an adverse manner.

4.3 Daylight

No adverse impact from the Seville exits from daylight obstruction on streets or
pedestrian ways. The Proposed Seville Project is modeled not to have daylight impact on
its neighbors. Design set backs of the top two floors, per preliminary BRA discussion,



The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                        Page 23
maintain the general perception and feel of the current environment and building's
massing. The Project's height and massing are consistent and slightly higher than the
current structure. Its general context will not change.

4.4 Solar Glare

No solar glare impacts will result from the Project. Traditional building materials are
proposed for the building. No highly reflective glass materials are planned for the
residential floors.

4.5 Air Quality Impacts

The Project does not require a micro scale air quality analysis. Project traffic projections
do not impact existing car counts causing a 10% increase to traffic. The Project is on two
bus routes that run into Central Square.

4.6 Noise Impacts

The acoustic levels found in an urban environment typically result from sounds generated
by motor vehicle traffic on local roadways. MBTA commuter trains and busses as well as
surrounding building mechanical systems will contribute to acoustic levels. Attached is a
common table of sound and decibel levels that one finds around the city.

DEP policy addresses noise as an air pollution control issue. The DEP DAQC Policy
Statement interprets a violation to have occurred if an increase of 10 dBA above ambient
levels occurs. The DEP does not regulate noise from motor vehicles and only applies the
policy to sources of generation following construction of the proposed project.

City of Boston Environmental Department regulates noise through their Air Pollution
Control Commission. The Project will be located in a mixed-use, community commercial
zone. The primary use of the area, by square footage, is commercial followed closely by
residential. The attached table outlines noise levels for Residential Zoning Districts.
Primary zoning and ambient area backgrounds find noise levels that occasionally surpass
those of the maximum allowable amount during activity in daytime hours. Nighttime
hours tend to see significant reductions and fall within the guidelines for residential
zoning districts.

The Project will comply with regulation 2.2 for noise levels in evening and parts of the
daytime for Residential Zoning Districts. The Projects mechanical equipments impacts
will be the only added sounds to ambient noise levels of the surrounding mixed-use
commercial area. The major additions will have no significant source impact to the
surrounding conditions. Individually, small heating package units and 1-3 ton AC unit
condensers are generally not considered in sound level impact analysis.

Small equipment located on roofs at Meridian elevation 2 and building rooftops are
anticipated to be equipment with low noise design. Emergency Generator Equipment is



The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                         Page 24
only anticipated if sprinkler system design requires a fire pump. It will be housed inside
the buildings parking area and vented to the exterior. Operational restrictions will be
programmed for the automatic tests of the Emergency Generator so it is not an
atmospheric contributor to noise. Mechanical exhaust equipment for the parking system
will be treated similarly.

Projected mechanical equipment on the second story roof when added, should total well
under 30 decibels when running simultaneously, which is the worst-case scenario. Noise
impacts are therefore predicted to be insignificant to background urban levels.

Predicted increases in sound levels during the day generally fall well below City of
Boston and Mass DEP Regulations. Anticipating full loads of mechanical equipments a
net increase should not exceed 4 dBA, which leaves levels well below the 50 dBA
maximum sounds level to assure compliance with DEP/Boston sound metrics ­
maximum sound levels.

The Proponent anticipates through the choice of mechanical equipment and its placement
that the standards for sound levels will not exceed City of Boston and DEP noise policies.
Projections from equipment suppliers indicated the placement of mechanical sound levels
will keep outputs of the project well below threshold noise regulations for maximum
sound levels.

4.7 Wetlands/Flood Hazard Zones

The Seville site slopes naturally from Meridian Street towards Boston Harbor. The
Seville property does not have any wetlands and falls outside the FEMA Coastal and
Flood Plain Management bounds. Since the site abuts The Liberty Plaza, which is at the
edge of Boston Harbor, its tidal variations are well catalogued. While final engineering
will determine process, standard erosion and sedimentation control measures will be


The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                         Page 25
utilized during earthwork and construction phases of the project to minimize impact on
local streets and the abutting properties.

4.8 Stormwater Management

The project will not affect the water quality of any nearby water bodies. The project will
include a Construction Stormwater Management Program and mitigation measures
during demolition and construction.

4.8.1 DEP Stormwater Management Policy Standards

A Stormwater Management Policy to address non-point source pollution will be
developed for the site prior to construction. The project will incorporate Best
Management Practices (BMP) to satisfy the DEP's Stormwater Management Standards.
The plan will address no net runoff from the site. The site does not have any wetlands and
will utilize the existing buildings stormwater runoff capacity.

Project Design Addresses DEP Stormwater Policy

Standard #1: No new stormwater conveyances (e.g. outfalls) may discharge untreated
stormwater directly or cause erosion in wetlands or waters of the Commonwealth.

Compliance-

No new untreated stormwater will be discharged to wetlands or waters of the
Commonwealth as a result of the project.

Standard #2: Stormwater Management Systems must be designed so that post-
development peak discharge rates do not exceed pre-development peak discharge rates.

Compliance-

The site is an urban one that essentially has a 100% impervious surface. No net increase
in peak discharge rate is anticipated.

Standard #3: Loss of annual recharge to groundwater should be minimized through the
use of infiltration measures to the maximum extent practicable. The annual recharge from
the post-development site should approximate the annual recharge from the pre-
development or existing site condition(s), based on soil types.

Compliance-

No net increase in impervious surface will be generated for the Project Site. Site
geotechnical data indicates urban fill, silts, cobbles, and some sandy silts.




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                         Page 26
Standard #4: For new development, Stormwater Management Systems must be designed
to remove 80% of the average annual load (post-development conditions) of totally
suspended solids, (TSS). It is presumed that this standard is met when:

    ·   Suitable non-structural practices for source control and pollution prevention are
        implemented;
    ·   Stormwater management best practice (BMPs) are sized to capture the prescribed
        runoff volume; and
    ·   Stormwater management BMPs are maintained as designed.

Compliance-

The site redevelopment starts with a 100% impervious cover. BMP will be maintained.

Standard #5: Stormwater discharges from areas with potential pollutant loads require the
use of specific stormwater management BMPs, (see chart). The use of infiltration
practices without pretreatment is prohibited.

Compliance-

The site is 100% impervious to begin and not considered a source of higher potential
pollutant load.

Standard #6: Stormwater discharge to critical areas must utilize certain stormwater BMP
approved for critical areas. Critical areas are Outstanding Resource Waters (ORWs),
shellfish beds, swimming beaches, cold-water fisheries and recharge areas for public
water supplies.

Compliance-

The project is not within a critical area, nor will discharge be released to a critical area.

Standard #7: Redevelopment of previously developed sites must meet the Stormwater
Management Standards to the maximum extent practicable. However, if it is not
practicable to meet all standards, new Stormwater Management Systems must be
designed to improve existing conditions.

Compliance-

The Seville is considered a redevelopment project. The project will meet the standards to
the maximum extent practicable.

Standard #8: Erosion and sediment controls must be implemented to prevent impacts
during construction or land disturbance activities.




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                            Page 27
Compliance-

The BMP will be implemented during construction to minimize adverse environmental
effects. Controls such as hay bales, trap rock, silt fence and catch basin fabrics will be
utilized along the site perimeter and at catch basins.

Standard #9: A long term BMP operation and maintenance plan is required to ensure
proper functioning of the SWM.

Compliance-

Final system management of installed equipment used will include the BMP operation
and maintenance plan should it be required.

4.8.2 Mitigation Measures

The Stormwater Management System will be comprised of standard drainage structures
outside the building. The parking entries and internal parking areas are subject to
receiving non-point source pollutants such as paved way urban pollutants, or construction
oriented pollutant runoffs.

Several BMPs could be implemented, however the Project Site does not impact wetlands
and will continue to utilize relief in the city stormwater system. Mitigation measures
anticipated for the parking garage will follow BMP.

4.9 Geotechnical and Groundwater Impacts

4.9.1 Project Site and Groundwater Impacts

Based on the data collected from 4 soil borings subsurface conditions at the Project Site,
please see the attached descriptions of consistent conditions.

    ·   Fill- The Project Site is underlain with a thin layer of 4 to 5 feet of fill.
    ·   Subsoil- Below the fill lies natural, compact to dense glacial outwash varying
        from sand, some gravel, and trace silt to a sand and gravel.
    ·   Glacial Till-Glacial till consisting of a dense to very dense sand and silt, some
        gravel, with cobbles and boulders was encountered at depths ranging from 30-43
        feet below existing ground surface, under the glacial outwash deposits.

4.9.2 Groundwater Conditions

Groundwater was encountered at depths ranging from 15/16' off Meridian Street and
10/13' off Border Street.




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                         Page 28
4.9.3 Excavation and Foundation Construction

Soil boring logs and strategic graphic cross sections are attached. Geotechnical Engineers
indicated the outwash deposit is well suited for a spread footing foundation system.

Report/Logs indicate current foundation and footings should be above the water table and
proposed new foundations are designed to continue that design option.

The design team has been directed to avoid water table impact and minimize excavation
by utilizing existing foundations as retaining walls where possible.

A spread footing foundation system will allow a slab on grade basement parking level
floor without need for uplift groundwater engineering. An under slab gravity relief
system will be used to protect slabs from intrusion.

Foundation and utility excavations for the proposed construction should not require
dewatering. However should it be required for short-term periods, sumps and excavation
pits on site will be used. BWSC requires a construction-dewatering permit should use of
their system be necessary. It is also not anticipated that a permit will be required for the
project from the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority for construction dewatering.
No blasting of bedrock is anticipated; (Commonwealth of MA regulation 57).

4.9.4 Probable Project Impact and Mitigation Measures

The Seville buildings are abutted on two sides by Meridian and Border Streets. Along the
Seville's north elevation the property abuts the City of Boston's East Boston Public
Library. The buildings are separated by open space of approximately 40 feet, building to
building. No adverse impact is expected on it or utilities to it.

On the direct north, another abutter exists. The mixed-use house is addressed at 272-274
Meridian Street and owned by Mr. Bruce Yochum. Approximately 62 feet 44 inches east
from the Border Street property corner, running on a North-South line, a common party
wall exists as a property line. The wall is by record the original wall of the Seville. The
project recognizes the challenges with new construction. The project intends to minimize
the impact with the abutter during the new construction. Project plans do not include any
structural disturbance of the existing wall. Visual impacts and fenestration applications to
the wall may be required. Some decorative adaptive measures at high elevations are
anticipated.

On the south elevation, the Seville buildings have two abutters. A two story commercial
structure with alley that is owned by like ownership and off Meridian Street by a mixed-
use 3-story structure. The ownership is by Luis Vasco. He purchased the 3 story wooden
structure, which stands independent of the Seville. No adverse impacts are expected on
either structure or the utilities that run to them.




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                          Page 29
4.10 Solid and Hazardous Materials

4.10.1 Solid Materials

The Seville buildings occupy space and configuration that will require safety oriented
urban deconstruction. Project estimates to date provide for internal site demolition by
section, with external yard recycling and staging. The key exterior component of both
buildings is masonry. Other internal construction materials exist, but volumetric analysis
indicates 65-70% of all materials removed from the site will be masonry based. Private
waste and recycling management will be the responsibility of the demolition contractor.
Their contractual responsibility will include meeting the DEP solid construction waste
target, and integrating the city and developers recycling goals into the site's waste
management program.

4.10.2 Hazardous Materials

The Project Site is not currently a generator of hazardous materials. Preliminary review
of the site indicates it is not on the USEPA CERCLA lists of superfund sites or the DEP
Massachusetts Contingency Plan, (MCP) list of sites to be investigated.

Available historical and surficial evidence doesn't recognize any above surface
environmental condition that would result in the presence of hazardous materials at this
site. Residual fuel oil may be present in active heating equipment and some grease and
solvents may be active in the shop area of the buildings. Based on the age of the theater it
is known to have building materials containing asbestos. All ACBM materials will be
identified and removed prior to demolition in accordance with EPA NESHAPS and MA
DEP policy.

4.11 Construction Impacts

The Proponent will employ a construction manager that will be responsible for the
development of a construction program. The construction program will include phasing,
staging, coordination, safety and regulatory sub programs to manage the project.

4.11.1 Construction Management Plan

A Construction Management Plan will be developed that outlines project phasing,
sequence hours of operation, regulatory compliance and documentation requirements,
BTD and BINS policy compliance, staging and safety policy. The Proponent will
contractually bind its construction manager and their contractors to work to the intent of
the project manual. Construction Management Plan methodologies and safety policy will
clearly define the communication process listing contacts, signage and emergency 24/7
contact information.

The Proponent recognizes that City of Boston code ordinance 16-26.4 allows
construction from 7am to 6pm Monday through Friday. If work is proposed outside those



The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                         Page 30
hours, the Boston Air Pollution Control Commissioner will be notified at the time a
permit is sought from the Commissioner of Inspectional Services Department.

Preliminary estimates on project start and completion are 18 months for a single phased
construction.

4.11.2 Construction Practices

Building Demolition

Demolition will take place with multiple technologies in sections as the building is
disassembled inbound to facilitate safety to the urban environment. Most work will be
done by crane and excavator with debris loaded to trucks for removal. Demolition
materials will be loaded and removed via Border Street. It is expected the Project Site
will be wetted down during the deconstruction and as per regulation during debris
removal to help control dust. Prior to leaving the Project Site, trucks will cover their
loads in order to prevent materials from being lost. If feasible, much of the masonry
materials in the existing buildings will be recycled.

Asbestos-containing materials will be removed from the existing buildings by a
Massachusetts licensed asbestos abatement contractor and disposed of as required by law
prior to demolition.

Perimeter Protection/Public Safety

The CMP will describe barrier placements and/or fencing, any necessary sidewalk
closures, and other measures deemed necessary to ensure safety around the site perimeter.
The nearby area sidewalks are expected to remain open to pedestrian traffic during the
construction period. Barricades and secure fencing will be used to isolate construction
areas from pedestrian activity

Construction Staging Areas

The Contractor will maintain a safe environment for both pedestrians and passing
vehicles. Staging is expected to occur on the Project Site above the fencing. All
construction activity will be kept within the designated areas approved by the
Construction Management Plan. There will be no stockpiling of fill, equipment or
materials, overnight or on weekends on public property or public ways unless prior
approval is granted through permitting for utility upgrades and repairs.

Best Management Practices

During construction, Best Management Practices for the control of erosion and the
discharge of sediment will be followed. Typically this will include the use of filter fabrics
around slopes and catch basins, stabilization of all slopes, the use of trap rock for




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                         Page 31
construction vehicles entering and leaving the site, and mechanical street sweeping as
necessary at the Project Site.

During the design and permitting process for the Project guidelines and specific measures
will be developed to ensure that during construction mitigation of sediments off of the
site is minimized or eliminated. Project specifications and plans will be developed during
this phase that will indicate and detail control measures and standards. Prior to the start of
construction a detailed Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) will be
developed. The SWPPP will include detailed site specific measures to be followed during
construction including: use restrictions for impact areas of the site and the standards to be
met.

Recycling of Construction and Demolition Debris

The Proponent will take an active role with regard to the reprocessing and recycling of
construction waste. Construction procedures will allow for the segregation, reprocessing,
reuse, and recycling of materials or donation to the Building Materials Resource Center,
where feasible. For those materials that cannot be recycled, solid waste will be
transported in covered trucks to an approved solid waste facility, per DEP's Regulations
for Solid Waste Facilities, 310 CMR 19.00. This requirement will be specified in the
disposal contract.

4.11.3 Transportation Impacts During Construction

Construction Vehicles and Routes

Trucks will be required to deliver supplies to the Project Site or its designated staging
area. The volume of trucks will be heavier during the site preparation and foundation
phase. The Construction Management Plan will prohibit greater than 5 minute vehicle
idling; it will be strictly controlled in accordance with Commonwealth of Massachusetts
law. Concrete pours and certain large volume deliveries will be the only known
exceptions at this time.

Specific truck routes will be established and made known to BTD through the CMP.
Construction contracts will include clauses restricting truck travel to routes established.
Maps showing approved truck routes will be provided to all suppliers, contractors, and
sub-contractors by the Construction Manager.

These established truck routes will prohibit travel on streets that penetrate any area
deemed sensitive to truck travel by BTD during planning. The Proponent will direct all
construction vehicles, delivery trucks, and employee vehicles to access and egress. The
Project Site will allow parking at the Liberty Plaza, and staging of some materials will
also occur there.




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                          Page 32
Construction Worker Access and Parking

It is anticipated that all construction workers will arrive and depart prior to peak traffic
periods. Limited parking in designated areas at the Liberty Plaza abutting the Project Site
will serve also as a lay down area. Parking will be discouraged or prohibited in the
immediate neighborhood side streets. Public transit use will be encouraged with the
Proponent and Construction Manager working aggressively to ensure the construction
workers are informed of the public transportation options serving the area. Space will be
made available for workers' supplies and tools to be securely stored on-site once
construction begins so that workers will not have to transport them on a daily basis,
further allowing workers to commute via public transit.

4.11.4 Construction Air Quality

The generation of dust occurs from construction activities. The following measures will
be employed to reduce potential generation of dust and airborne particles:

    ·   Wetting agents will be used regularly to control and suppress dust that may come
        from the construction materials and from demolition;
    ·   All trucks for transportation of construction debris will be fully covered;
    ·   Storage of construction debris on site will be kept to a minimum;
    ·   Actual construction practices will be monitored to ensure those unnecessary
        transfers and mechanical disturbances of loose materials are minimized and to
        ensure that emissions of dust are negligible; and
    ·   To minimize dust and mud accumulations in city streets periodic sweeping may
        be utilized to maintain an acceptable street/sidewalk condition.

4.11.5 Construction Noise

Every reasonable effort will be made to minimize the noise impact of construction
activities. Mitigation measures will include:

    ·   Scheduling of work during daytime hours;
    ·   Using appropriate mufflers on equipment and providing ongoing maintenance of
        any intake and exhaust mufflers;
    ·   Maintaining muffling enclosures on continuously operating equipment, such as air
        compressors and welding generators;
    ·   Replacing specific construction operations and techniques by less noisy ones
        where feasible- e.g. using vibration pile driving instead of impact driving if
        practical;
    ·   Selecting the quietest practical items of equipment- e.g., electric instead of diesel
        powered equipment;
    ·   Selecting equipment operations to keep average levels low, to synchronize
        noisiest operations with times of highest ambient levels, and to maintain relatively
        uniform noise levels;

    ·   Turn off idle equipment; and
    ·   Locating noisy equipment at locations that protect sensitive locations by shielding
        or distance.

4.11.6 Rodent Control

The City of Boston has declared that the infestation of rodents is a serious problem in the
community. In order to control this infestation, the city enforces requirements established
under the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, Chapter 11, 105 CMA 410.550 and the
State Building Code, Section 108.6 Policy number 87-4 established that extermination of
rodents shall be required for issuance of permits of demolition, excavation, foundation,
and basement rehabilitation.

The first construction activity prior to demolition will be to treat the existing buildings
and surrounding areas for rodent activity. A formal rodent control program will be
established prior to the start of demolition, and all areas of the Project will be treated to
comply with all city and regulatory requirements.

5.0 Transportation Component

5.1 Introduction

The Project site is located in the East Boston neighborhood of Boston and is bounded to
the north by the East Boston Public Library, to the east by Meridian Street, to the south
by retail, and to the west by Border Street (see Figure 1). This section of the Project
Notification Form (PNF) details the transportation conditions around the site for the
Existing, No-Build, and Build conditions.

5.1.1 Purpose of the Report

This study was commissioned by the Proponent in an effort to meet the requirements of
the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) and in accordance with the Boston
Transportation Department (BTD) Transportation Access Plan Guidelines (2001). The
study team conducted a transportation analysis for the proposed Project that includes the
following:

    ·   Definition and presentation of existing traffic, including roadway capacities,
        parking, transit, pedestrian circulation, loading, and overall Project site
        conditions.
    ·   An evaluation of the Project's long-term impacts on traffic, including roadway
        capacities, parking, transit, pedestrian circulation, loading, and overall Project site
        conditions.
    ·   An evaluation of the Project's short-term traffic impacts related to construction
        activity.
    ·   Identification of appropriate measures to mitigate Project impacts, including but
        not limited to roadway improvements, pedestrian amenities, a transportation
        demand management program, and participation in Transportation Management
        Associations.

5.1.2 Project Description

The proposed Project involves construction of a new structure consisting of
approximately 65 residential condominium units and approximately 14,000 square feet of
ground-floor retail space. Resident parking for 40 vehicles will be provided on-site in a
garage. The proposed building will replace the existing Seville Theater building,
formerly used as office, retail, and theater.

The transportation study evaluates the transportation impacts resulting from the proposed
structure consisting of approximately 65 residential condominium units, approximately
15,000 square feet of retail space, and 40 parking spaces for residential use.

5.1.3 Study Methodology

This section describes the transportation components of the proposed Project in
accordance with BTD Transportation Access Plan Guidelines (2001). The transportation
study was conducted in three parts. The first constitutes an inventory of existing
transportation conditions, including roadway capacities, parking, transit, pedestrian,
circulation, loading, and site conditions. The second evaluates future transportation
conditions and assesses potential traffic impacts associated with the Project. Long-term
impacts were evaluated for the year 2012, five years from when the data collection and
analysis were conducted. Expected roadway, parking, transit, pedestrian, and loading
capacities and deficiencies were identified. This section of the transportation impact
study includes the following scenarios:

    ·   A No-Build Scenario, including general background growth;
    ·   A Build Scenario, including specific travel demand forecasts for the Project at the
        site; and
    ·   An evaluation of short-term traffic impacts associated with construction activity.

The final section of this transportation impact study evaluates the findings to determine
whether there are any issues that require mitigation.

5.1.4 Study Area

The study area is generally bounded by Central Square to the north and south, Meridian
Street to the east, and Border Street to the west. The study area, shown in Figure 2,

consists of a single 10-foot lane in each direction, northbound and southbound, through
the intersection. A crosswalk is provided across the driveway. Parking is allowed on
both sides of Border Street.

5.2.3 Traffic Conditions

Due to the residential nature of the Project, turning movement counts were conducted
during typical residential peak travel periods from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. and from 4:00 to
6:00 p.m. on Thursday, September 13, 2007. Based on the turning movement counts, the
study team identified the weekday peak hours as 8:00­9:00 a.m. and 4:30­5:30 p.m. The
existing peak-hour turning movement volumes for the study area intersections are shown
in Figure 3 and Figure 4 for the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, respectively. Complete traffic
count data are included in Appendix C-1.

5.2.4 Existing Traffic Operations

Traffic operations are determined through an analysis of intersection Level of Service
(LOS). The study team analyzed LOS and delay at the intersections, using Trafficware's
Synchro 6 software, which is based on the traffic operational analysis methodology of the
Transportation Research Board's 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). LOS and
delay (in seconds) are determined based on intersection geometry and available traffic
data for each intersection. Signal timings and phasing used in this analysis were obtained
from BTD. Derived from the HCM, Table 1 provides LOS criteria for signalized and
unsignalized intersections. LOS A defines the most favorable condition, with minimum
traffic delay. LOS F represents the worst condition (unacceptable), with significant
traffic delay. LOS D is generally considered acceptable in an urban environment.

The volume-to-capacity ratio ("v/c") ratio is a measure of congestion at an intersection
approach. A v/c ratio of 1 or greater indicates that the intersection approach exceeds
capacity.

The 95th percentile queue represents the farthest extent of the queue (to the last stopped
vehicle) upstream from the stop line over 95% of all cycles. The 95th percentile queue is
not seen during every cycle. The study team performed field observations to establish
intersection geometry (i.e., number of turning lanes, lane length, and lane width). Signal
phasing and timing data were provided by BTD.

A level of service analysis evaluating existing intersection operations was calibrated
based on field observations of actual queues and delays. Table 2 and Table 3 show
existing intersection LOS results for the study area during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours,
respectively. Complete Synchro reports are provided in Appendix C-2.

Intersection approaches in the study area operate at acceptable overall levels of service
(LOS D or better) during the a.m. and p.m. and peak hours, with the following
exceptions:

Meridian Street/Saratoga Street/Central Square. Overall, this signalized intersection
operates at LOS F during the p.m. peak hour. The Meridian Street northbound approach
operates at LOS F, with all other approaches operating at LOS C or better during the p.m.
peak hour.

Porter Street/Bennington Street/Central Square. During the a.m. and p.m. peak hours,
the Porter Street/Bennington Street westbound approach operates at LOS F at this
unsignalized intersection.

Liverpool Street/Central Square/Meridian Street. The Central Square eastbound left-
turn approach operates at LOS D in the a.m. peak hour and LOS F in the p.m. peak hour.

5.2.5 Existing Parking/Curbside Inventory

Existing On-Street Parking

A summary of on-street parking within a quarter-mile of the Project site is shown in
Figure 5. The majority of parking spaces are unrestricted and 2-hour. In the immediate
vicinity of the Project site, on-street parking is mostly unrestricted on both Border and
Meridian Streets. Observations by the study team indicate that double-parking frequently
occurs at businesses along Central Square, often impeding traffic flow.

Existing Off-Street Parking

The existing site supplies no off-street parking.

The only off-street parking in the area is private Massport parking lots at the entrance to
the Callahan Tunnel, shown in Figure 6.

5.2.6 Existing Public Transportation

The Project site is approximately one-half mile (a ten-minute walk) from Maverick
Station, providing access to the MBTA Blue Line, and several MBTA local bus routes.

Weekday bus and subway service is provided between approximately 5:00 a.m. and 1:00
a.m. Actual service times vary by route or line. Table 4 summarizes train and bus routes
and frequencies. MBTA public transportation services, exclusive of commuter rail lines,
are shown in Figure 7.

  5.3 Evaluation of Long-Term Traffic Impacts

  5.3.1 No-Build Scenario

  Background Traffic Growth

  No-Build traffic conditions are independent of the proposed Project and include all
  existing traffic and any new traffic resulting from both general background growth and
  any identified development projects in the area. The No-Build condition is used to
  evaluate the cumulative impacts of the anticipated future traffic increases, while
  providing a baseline of comparison for the proposed Project.

  Two procedures are used to determine background traffic growth. The first is to apply a
  general growth rate to account for changes in demographics, auto usage, and ownership.
  This analysis assumes a general background growth rate of 2% per year, as directed by
  BTD.

  The second procedure is to estimate traffic generated by planned new major
  developments and anticipated roadway changes. Due to the fact that there are no planned
  developments on file with the City in the area of the proposed project, no area projects
  were used for background traffic growth.

  No-Build Traffic Operations

  The 2012 No-Build analysis uses the methodology described for Existing Conditions.
  No-Build traffic volumes are shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9 The resulting intersection
  operations, assuming the mitigation described above, are shown in Table 5 and Table 6.
  Complete Synchro reports are provided in Appendix C-2.

Under No-Build Conditions, LOS worsens from Existing Conditions to LOS D or lower
for the following intersections and approaches:

Meridian Street/Saratoga Street/Central Square. During the a.m. peak hour, the overall
LOS worsens from LOS C to LOS D. In addition, the Meridian Street northbound
approach worsens from LOS D to LOS F. In the p.m. peak hour, the Central Street
eastbound left-turn approach worsens from LOS C to LOS D.

Liverpool Street/Central Square/Meridian Street. The Central Square eastbound left-
turn approach worsens from LOS D to LOS E.

Border Street/Central Square. In the p.m. peak hour, the Border Street southbound
approach worsens from LOS C to LOS E.

As noted previously, No-Build Conditions include a 2% annual growth rate to account for
new development in the area. Although this rate seems high for an urban area, it was
recommended by BTD.

5.3.2 Build Scenario

The proposed Build scenario assumes construction of a new building with approximately
65 residential condominium units and 15,000 square feet of retail. Parking for 40
vehicles will be provided on-site in a garage. To provide a conservative estimate, this
analysis includes no credit for the trips associated with the existing building; all person
trips and vehicle trips associated with the proposed residential units and restaurant use are
assumed to be new trips.

5.3.2.1 Site Access and Circulation

Vehicular Access and Circulation

Vehicular access and egress to the proposed building will be provided on both Meridian
and Border Streets (see Figure 10). Parking will be provided only for residents of the
condominiums.

Pedestrian Access

Pedestrian access to and from the residential component of the building is provided on
Meridian Street. Access to the retail components will be from Meridian and Border
Streets.

5.3.2.2 Trip Generation

Appendix C-3 presents detailed trip generation for the proposed Project land uses. Trip
generation data were derived from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip
Generation, 7th Edition (2003), trip rates. This analysis uses a vehicle occupancy rate of
1.2 for residential uses and 1.8 for retail uses, based on 2001 National Household Travel


The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                         Page 47
Survey occupancy rates, to convert the unadjusted ITE vehicle trips into person trips.
The assignment of person trips to the various transportation modes is presented in the
following section. For person trips assigned to auto use, the analysis uses a local vehicle
occupancy rate of 1.17 for residential and 1.8 for retail to convert the person trips into
vehicle trips. This local rate is based on the 2000 U.S. Census data and the 2001 National
Household Travel Survey. The analysis uses the following ITE land use code to estimate
Project trips:

LUC 230--Residential Condominium/Townhouse: Residential
condominiums/townhouses are defined as ownership units that have at least one other
owned unit within the same building structure. Both condominiums and townhouses are
included in this land use. Due to the inherent characteristics of the proposed residential
uses, including:

    ·   proximity to public transportation and the downtown area

    ·   low residential occupancy per unit (i.e., mostly one-bedroom units); and

    ·   provision of a resident shuttle service.

It is likely that overall auto ownership and vehicle trip generation per unit will be lower
than that of the typical "condominium" use; however, the study team believes this LUC
provides the best match in terms of trip generation characteristics. This trip generation
analysis provides a conservative estimate.

Land Use Code 820--Shopping Center. A shopping center is an integrated group of
commercial establishments that is planned, developed, owned, and managed as a unit. A
shopping center's composition is related to its market area in terms of size, location, and
type of store. A shopping center also provides on-site parking facilities sufficient to
serve its own parking demands. Specialty retail center (Land Use 814) and factory outlet
center (Land Use 823) are related uses.

5.3.2.3 Mode Split

The mode split for the Project was based on 2000 U.S. Census data and BTD data for
Area 7 around the site. Vehicle occupancies were based on the 2001 National Household
Travel Survey rates and the 2000 Census data for local trips. Mode use is presented in
Table 7 and Appendix C-4. Transit/ walk trips account for approximately 55% of
residential and retail peak-hour trips; the transit and walk mode shares are due largely to
the proximity of the site to public transportation and the downtown East Boston area.
Many residents do not use their cars for work; the vehicles remain in the garage until
used for evening on weekend errands, trips, etc.

Vehicle trip generation for the Project is shown in Table 8, which compares the retail,
residential, and total new Project trips. To provide a conservative estimate of the Project
trip generation, no credit was taken for the existing use on-site. Detailed trip generation
for the proposed Project is included in Appendix C-3.

As the table shows, estimated daily vehicle trips to and from the site total 482, with 241
trips in and 241 out. In the a.m. peak hour, an estimated 6 vehicle trips in and 15 out will
occur; in the p.m. peak hour, 16 vehicles in and 37 out.

To provide a conservative analysis, no credit was taken for the vehicle trips associated
with the existing uses on-site. Therefore, all trips associated with the proposed uses were
assumed to be new trips. Also, in order to be conservative, the trip generation includes
retail vehicle trips, even though parking is not included for retail uses. The patrons and
employees of the new retail uses would operate in a fashion similar to those of the
existing retail space, parking in available spaces on the adjacent streets.

5.3.2.4 Trip Distribution

Based on BTD guidelines, the study team developed vehicular trip distribution data using
origin­destination characteristics for Area 7. The distribution appears in Figure 11. The
new Project-generated trips added to study area intersections during the peak hours are
shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13.

5.3.2.5 Build Traffic Operations

Figure 14 and Figure 15 show the 2012 Build morning and evening peak-hour traffic
volumes, accounting for the background growth rate, anticipated development by others,
and Project-generated trips. The LOS analysis conducted using the methodology
described for Existing Conditions appears in Table 9 and Table 10.

The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                                               Page 52
Due to the low volume of traffic generated by the Project, minimal changes occur under
Build Conditions. With the Project in place, no LOS for overall intersections,
intersection approaches, or lane groups is expected to worsen. It should again be noted
that to provide a conservative estimate of intersection operations, no credit was taken for
vehicle trips associated with the existing use of the site. The anticipated changes from
No-Build to Build Conditions consist of only a small increase in delay at study area
intersections.

5.3.2.6 Build Conditions Parking

The proposed building will provide approximately 40 parking spaces for residents within
a new parking garage. Garage parking will be accessed from either Meridian Street or
Border Street. Tenants will be assigned spaces. Parking provisions are consistent with
BTD guidelines for the area (0.75­1.25 spaces per residential unit). No parking will be
provided for the retail space. Workers associated with the retail space will be
encouraged to take public transit or walk, given its close proximity to MBTA bus and
rapid transit services.

The Proponent will explore utilizing a shared-car service, such as Zipcar, to determine
the feasibility of establishing shared-car spaces within the parking garage, which will
further help to reduce residents' need for automobiles.

5.3.2.7 Build Conditions Public Transportation

The study team estimates that nearly one-quarter of all trips made to and from the
building will occur via public transportation. As shown in Table 11, the Proposed
Project will add an estimated 198 transit trips per day, with 15 new transit trips (10
boarding and 5 alighting) during the a.m. peak and 30 new trips (13 boarding and 17
alighting) during the p.m. peak. These trips will be dispersed to the various inbound and
outbound transit and bus lines in the study area.

5.3.2.8 Pedestrian Access and Operations

On a daily basis, the Project will generate an estimated 450 new walk trips and an
additional 198 new transit trips that require a walk to or from the Site. This results in an
additional 648 new pedestrian trips per day. Approximately 19 walk trips in and out of
the site will occur during the a.m. peak hour, and 38 walk trips in and out will occur
during the p.m. peak hour, plus 15 and 30 transit trips, respectively. When combined,
this averages to approximately 1 additional pedestrian trip per minute during the a.m. and
p.m. peak hours. The new walk trip generation is summarized in Table 12.

                          Table 12.        Walk Trip

5.3.2.9 Bicycle Accommodations

The Proponent will explore making secure bicycle storage available to residents, workers,
and visitors of the building. All bicycle racks, signs, and parking areas would conform to
BTD standards and be sited in safe, secure locations. The Proponent will explore placing
bicycle racks within the parking garage to provide safe and convenient storage for
residents and one rack outside the building for visitors and guests. The Proponent will
work with BTD to identify the most appropriate location for bicycle racks close to the
Project site.

5.3.2.10 Loading and Service

All recycling, trash collection, and loading activities will occur on-street as they do today.

Most residential deliveries are in smaller vehicles--cars, vans, or small panel trucks.
Deliveries in this sized vehicle will be made from the street, as they are today. Trash will
be stored within a separate enclosure and wheeled out for curbside pickup on Border
Street.




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                          Page 54
All retail servicing, including trash pick-up, will occur at the curb on Border Street, as it
does today. Access to the retail will be provided through an internal hallway. Trash will
be collected and stored within the designated trash room.

5.4 Transportation Mitigation Measures

The proposed redevelopment of the existing site will have a negligible impact on area
roadways, as summarized in Table 9 and Table 10, above. Since residents and patrons in
the area commute predominantly on foot, by bike, or by public transportation, potential
impacts on peak-hour vehicular traffic are minimal. Therefore, no traffic mitigation is
warranted on the street network adjacent to the Project site.

5.5 Transportation Demand Management

The Proponent is committed to implementing a TDM program that supports the City's
efforts to reduce dependency on the automobile by encouraging travelers to use
alternatives to driving alone, especially during peak periods. TDM will be facilitated by
the nature of the Project and its proximity to public transit alternatives.

The Proponent is prepared to take advantage of the Site's convenient transit and
pedestrian access to market to future residents and workers within the building. The
property management company will provide transit information (schedules, maps, fare
information) in the building lobby for residents, workers, and guests. The property
management company will also work with residents as they move in to raise awareness of
public transportation alternatives.

Additional TDM measures may include the following:

    ·   Tenant and Resident Orientation Packet. These packets will provide all new
        tenants with information concerning available TDM programs and public
        transportation in the area, including route maps, schedules, and fare information.
    ·   Bicycle Storage. The Project Proponent will explore providing secure bicycle
        storage and making it available to residents, workers, and visitors.
    ·   Car-sharing Service. The Proponent will also evaluate the feasibility of
        establishing a shared-car space on-site within the parking garage in coordination
        with a car-sharing service.

5.6 Conclusions

The vehicular traffic generated by the Project will have a negligible impact on the
surrounding roadways. The intersection LOS does not degrade at any location under
2012 Build Conditions. The Project intends to take advantage of its proximity to transit,
particularly local bus routes and Maverick Station on the MBTA Blue Line. Many trips
to and from the Project are expected to be made on foot or via transit, with a combined
43% and 45% of all Project-generated trips being made via these modes in the a.m. and
p.m. peak hours, respectively.


The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                          Page 55
The Proponent is limiting the number of parking spaces to be provided on-site to 40
spaces, a ratio of 0.7 spaces/unit of residential housing, which is within the BTD
guidelines for parking in East Boston. No off-street parking will be provided for the
retail component, which is consistent with the parking situation for the existing retail uses
on the site.

Based on these elements of the Project, no off-site traffic mitigation is required of the
Project since it has no adverse impact on the surrounding roadway network.

6.0 Historic Resources Component

The Project Site does not contain historical structures that are listed on the National or
State Register of Historic Places or in the Massachusetts Historical Commission (MHC)
Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets of the Commonwealth.

According to a review of local historic properties, the nearest historical structure is in the
Princeton Street Architectural Conservation District, located at 39-41 Princeton Street,
approximately 371 feet from the Seville site. Various other historic structures exist from
between 1/3 of a mile to 1.4 miles away from the Project Site. These structures include,
Trinity Neighborhood House at 406 Meridian Street (1/3 mile), the Donald McKay
House at 78-80 White Street (.4 miles), the Street Clock at 9 Chelsea Street (1/2 mile),
and the Baker Congregational Church at 760 Saratoga Street (1.4 miles). The Seville
redevelopment will not adversely impact these historical structures, which are separated
from the Project Site by other properties or streets.

The two existing buildings on the Project Site are the Seville Theater, 248-270 Meridian
Street. Both of these buildings are believed to be over 50 years old. The Proponent will
confer with the Boston Landmarks Commission regarding the need for filing of a Request
for Determination of Applicability under Article 85 Demolition Delay of the Boston
Zoning Code prior to building demolition.

Archaeological Resources

There are no known or designated archaeological properties on the Project Site. Given the
previous site development, there is little potential for the presence of archaeological
resources that might be disturbed by the Project.

7.0 Infrastructure System Component

7.1 Introduction

The following analysis describes the existing utility systems servicing the Project area.
The East Boston site will be reviewed for probable impacts that the Proposed Project may
have on the utilities, and identifies mitigation measures to address potential impacts of
the Proposed Project.

The Proponent has initiated contact with those responsible for the area's utility systems,
including the Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC) to understand and evaluate
each system and design the Proposed Project to prevent disruption of utility services. A
BWSC Site Plan and General Service Application is required for the proposed new water,
sewer and drain connections. In addition, a Pollution Prevention Plan will be submitted
specifying best management measures for protecting the BWSC drainage system during
construction. A Drainage Discharge permit will also be required prior to discharge of any
construction dewater.

Meetings will be scheduled as necessary during building design and permitting processes,
Updated design and reuse of connections as appropriate, will be provided as the project
plans develop. Sewer, water, storm drainage, and electric utilities are discussed below.

The project consists of a parcel with frontage on Meridian and Border Streets. It includes
approximately 17,481 square feet of land. The Site is located on the east side of Border
Street and the west side of Meridian Street. The site is one block from Central Square.
The proposed project includes 65 units of housing to be constructed on this parcel.

7.2 Existing Sewer System

The BWSC owns, operates and maintains the sewer system in the vicinity of the overall
Project Site. The Seville is served by a 20 inch combined sewer/drain line in Border
Street that flows in a southerly direction from the Project Site. The Border Street
combined sewer/drain lines connect to combined sewer/drain lines that run to Central
Square, parallel to a 15 inch MWRA sewer line in Border Street, that flows in a northerly
direction from the Project Site (see survey). The sanitary sewage system ultimately
connects to the MWRA system where it is treated at the MWRA Deer Island Treatment
Plant.

Project-Generated Sewage Flow

The Proposed Project's sanitary sewage system will connect to the area's existing BWSC
sanitary sewage system. The Proposed Project will generate an estimated flow in gallons
per day (gpd) as calculated below. This calculation was based on 314 CMR 7.15 (Sewer
System Connection and Extension Permit Program), which provides design flow
parameters for various building uses.




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                       Page 58
Proposed Project

85 bedrooms @ 110 gallons per bedroom                       =9350 gpd

Proposed Retail/office 18,0002ft @ 75g/10002ft              =1350 gpd

                                                            10,700 gpd

Sanitary Sewage Connection

Sanitary sewage connections from the project site will be made to the existing combine
sewers in Border Street, which currently service the building. A Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Sewer Connection Permit will not be
required for any of these sites since the calculated sewage flow is below 15,000 gpd. In
order to obtain service approval, the Proponent will submit a General Service Application
and Connection Plan to the BWSC for review and approval.

Sewer System Mitigation

To help conserve water and reduce the amount of wastewater generated by the Proposed
Project, LEED design standards and in compliance with code, water conservation devices
will be planned for using 1.6 gallons/flush water closets for future project applications.

7.3 Water System

Existing Water Service

The BWSC provides water service to the City of Boston through a well developed
network of pipes, which is supplied by the MWRA transmission system. There are two
existing water mains in the vicinity of the Project Site. There are two 20 inch service
mains in both Border and Meridian Streets. Service to the Project Site will most likely
come from the service main in Border Street, however, Meridian is an option based on
BWSC final system choices.

Anticipated Water Consumption

Water consumption is based on sewage generation with an added factor for consumption.
Based on the projected combined project total sewage generation of 10,700 gpd, it is
estimated that the Proposed Project will require approximately 12,000 gpd of water. The
heating and cooling systems for the building have not yet been designed; however air
condition make-up water requirements are anticipated to be minimal if any, given the
relatively small project scope for the Site.




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                       Page 59
Proposed Water Service

Domestic water and fire service will be provided from existing services supplying water
from mains in either Border or Meridian Street.

BWSC has indicated more than adequate capacity in the water supply system to serve the
Proposed Project. Flow tests will be performed for final design of the proposed building
fire suppression system during the detailed design phases.

Water service to the building will be metered in accordance with the Commission's Site
Plan Requirements. The Project Proponent will provide for the connection of the meter to
the Commission's automatic meter reading system consistent with current BWSC policy.
Backflow prevention devices will be installed on all fire services where required to
protect from cross-connection hazards. Water supply systems servicing the Project will
be gated so as to minimize public hazard or inconvenience in the event of a water main
break. The Proponent will also submit a General Service Application and Site Plan to the
BWSC for review and approval.

Water Supply System Mitigation

The State Building Code requires the use of water conserving fixtures. Water
conservation measures such as low flow water closets and restricted flow showerheads
will help reduce the domestic water demand on the existing distribution system. These
systems will be installed consistent with the code requirements.

7.4 Storm Drainage System

7.4.1 Existing Storm Drainage System

The Seville is serviced by stormwater systems located in both Meridian and Border
Streets. The drainage system is owned and maintained by the BWSC. Existing runs are
20 inches in Border Street and 24 inches in Meridian Street. The Seville is projected to
connect to both lines.

7.4.2 Proposed Storm Drainage

The project site consists of a fully impervious group of surfaces. Redevelopment plans
will modify the site, however there will be no net change. Rainwater from roofs will be
collected, relieved internally and sent by gravity to a to be determined connection- either
currently in place or designed new. Currently, some alternative relief uses with green
design options are under consideration for clean-water reuse.

Garage proposed drainage will utilize an oil water separator prior to release of product to
the BSW distribution system. Existing sewer and drain connections not deemed for reuse
will be terminated in accordance with BWSC standard. The proponent will work with the




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                         Page 60
BWSC during review and submit its modification request under a General Service
Application and site plan.

7.5 Electric System

7.5.1 Existing Electric Systems

NStar provides electric service in the City of Boston. There are existing lines in both
streets abutting the project with services (multiple) active in the structures.

7.5.2 Proposed Electric Connections

The electrical, space heating and energy systems for the proposed Project have not yet
been designed. However, it is not expected that the Project will require modest power
requirements. No capacity issues are anticipated as the Project is in a dense, commercial
and mixed-use developed area. Electric power supply design will be further coordinated
with NStar as the Project design progresses and electric consumption is determined.

In addition, to the extent possible, energy-saving measures will be incorporated into
building design and construction. Transformer placement is not expected to disrupt
pedestrian paths in the vicinity of, or abutting the Project Site.

The Proponent will investigate the installation of energy efficient lighting, heating and
cooling systems in the design for the Project. It is not expected that solar energy is cost-
effective and feasible for use in the project.

7.6 Telephone System

Verizon New England provides telephone service in the Project area. There is overhead
telephone service in the area.

Telephone service will be brought into the Project Site and distributed through the Project
via underground facilities.

7.7 Cable System

Comcast and RCN provide cable service in the Project area. Cable lines already exist in
both Border and Meridian Streets to service the Project.

It is anticipated that Comcast or RCN who currently provide cable service in the Project
area will provide cable to the Project Site by way of underground vaults and cables
installed through the Project Site. No capacity issues are anticipated.




The Seville on Boston Harbor                                                          Page 61
7.8 Gas/Steam Systems

KeySpan Energy provides natural gas service in the Project area. There are existing gas
lines in both Border and Meridian Streets to service the project.

It is not expected that the Project would require excessive amounts of gas. In addition, to
the extent possible, energy-saving measures will be incorporated into the building design
and construction.

7.9 Utility Protection During Construction

During construction, infrastructure will be protected using sheeting and shoring,
temporary relocations, and construction staging as required. The contractor will be
required to coordinate all protection measures, temporary supports, and temporary
shutdowns of all utilities with the appropriate utility owners and/or agencies. The
contractor will also be required to provide adequate notification to the utility owner prior
to work commencing on their utility. Also, in the event a utility cannot be maintained in
service during switch over to a temporary or permanent system, the contractor will be
required to coordinate the shutdown with the utility owners and Project abutters to
minimize impacts and inconveniences accordingly.
